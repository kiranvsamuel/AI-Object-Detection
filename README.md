# AI-Object-Detection
AI-Powered Object Detection model using Azure AI Custom Vision, ONNX, and C#

Implementation of models using the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) in C#. Building a custom vision model that runs offline with minimal resource usage is incredibly cool. I tried creating a vision model inferencing in a C# UWP application that captures hand signs, makes real-time predictions, and displays bounding boxes and probabilities, all while operating entirely offline. Leveraging cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, it analyzes images with stunning accuracy, achieving high mean average precision even with a limited training dataset.
